I am currently a first year student at the [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/) pursuing *MS in Visualization*, a specialization in Computer Graphics. I completed my *Bachelors with Honors in Computer Science and Engineering* from [IIIT, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) in May, 2019.

I am passionate about developing scalable software and research that aids the advancement of the Computer Graphics field. I am also interested in parallel algorithms and enjoy writing GPU accelarated programs. Additionally, my interests include machine learning and reinforcement learning, and their applications in Computer Graphics. I like working with Virtual Reality systems and performing surveys to gain insights to the Human Computer Interaction techniques.

In my free time, I play soccer, watch historic documentaries and read dystopian fiction. I have won multiple intra-college soccer tournaments and have been a part of the IIIT Hyderabad Soccer team as a right attacking winger.
